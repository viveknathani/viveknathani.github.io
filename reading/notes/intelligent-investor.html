<h1>Notes from The Intelligent Investor</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>An investment operation is one which upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and an adequate return. The complement of this is speculation which should be avoided.</p></li>

<li><p>Invest only if you would be comfortable owning a stock even if you had no way of knowing its daily share price.</p></li>

<li><p>It is important to measure your investing success not just by what you make, but by how much you keep after inflation.</p></li>

<li><p>Future growth of a stock market index depends upon three things :</p>

<p>(i) Real growth (the rise of companies earnings and dividends)</p>

<p>(ii) Inflation</p>

<p>(iii) Speculative growth – or decline (any increase or decrease in the investing public’s appetite for stocks)</p></li>

<li><p>Becoming more familiar with a subject does not significantly reduce it people’s tendency to exaggerate how much they actually know about it. The more you know going in, the less likely you are to probe a stock for weaknesses. This is “home bias”. Familiarity breeds complacency.</p></li>

<li><p>Dollar cost averaging – buy a fixed amount into index funds every month as a defensive investor.</p></li>

<li><p>Our brains are designed to perceive trends, even when they might not exist.</p></li>

<li><p>What factor determines how much you should be willing to pay for a stock? The five elements are:</p></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>The company’s general Long term prospects</li>
<li>The quality of its management</li>
<li>It’s financial strength and capital structure</li>
<li>It’s dividend record</li>
<li>And it’s current dividend rate</li>
</ul>

<p>Download at least 5 years worth of annual reports and comb thru the statements to help answer two overriding questions.</p>

<p>1) will this company grow?</p>

<p>2) where do profits come from?</p>

<p>Problems to look out for</p>

<ul>
<li>Serial acquirers: an average of 2–3 acquisitions per year is a sign of trouble. It would rather invest more in other’s business than its own</li>
<li>Company is OPM Addict. “other people’s money”. Keeps raising money from selling stock or debt.</li>
<li>Company is Johnny one note – relying on one customer or a handful for most of its revenues.</li>
</ul>

<p>Good signs</p>

<ul>
<li>Company has a wide moat – or competitive advantage. Such as a strong brand identity (Nike, Apple), a monopoly economics of scale (Amazon), intangible asset (Coca cola formula), resistance to substitution (banks, utilities)</li>
<li>Company is a marathoner, not a sprinter. growth rates are controlled at sustainable rates</li>
<li>The company sows and reaps. Companies generally also invests in R&amp;D at a % of sales</li>
</ul>

<p>The quality and conduct of management (blame culture vs accountability).</p>

<ul>
<li>Do they do what they say?</li>
<li>Are they looking out for number 1?.. high ceo pays, reevaluating options..</li>
<li>Are they managers or promoters?</li>
</ul>

<p>Financial strength and capital structure</p>

<ul>
<li>Any costs of granting stock options which divert earnings away from existing shareholders into the hands of inside owners</li>
<li>Any unusual nonrecurring or extra ordinary charges</li>
<li>Any income from company’s pension fund</li>
<li>Long term debt should be &lt; 50% of company’s capital</li>
<li>Look for ratio of earnings to fixed charges</li>
<li>Burden of proof is on company to show that your are better off not paying dividends, if business is still under performing, means managers are misusing cash instead of paying a dividend</li>
<li>Companies should buy back shares when it is cheap, not overpriced</li>
<li>Beware of companies who keep splitting stock</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li><p>Learn how to interpret financial statements.</p></li>

<li><p>Read financial reports backwards, anything that company doesn’t want you to find is hidden at the back.</p></li>

<li><p>IV=E(8.5+2G)* 4.4/Y</p>

<p>IV = Intrinsic value.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>E = Earnings per share</p>

<p>G = Expected growth rate</p>

<p>Y = current yield on AAA-rated corporate bonds</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Successful investment professionals have 2 things in common. 1) they are disciplined and consistent, not changing approach even when it is unfashionable 2) they think a great deal about what they do and how to do it, paying little attention to what the market is doing.</p></li>

<li><p>The difference between the intrinsic value and the current market price is the margin of safety. The greater the margin of safety the safer the investment.</p></li>
</ol>
