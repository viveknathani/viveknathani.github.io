<h1>Hi, I am Vivek!</h1>

<p><div>
I am an engineering student based in India with a passion for software development. My skills include building backends in Node.js and TypeScript, CLI tools in Go and occasionally, building user interfaces using React.</p>

<p>Find out more about me: <a href="./work">projects</a> | <a href="./blog">blog</a> | <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16dQb5zN6FYl0dFurLYl3Ojxdu0qiIdUn/view?usp=sharing">resume</a></p>

<p>If you are interested in working with me,<br>
- write an email to viveknathani2402@gmail.com<br>
- or DM me on <a href="https://twitter.com/viveknathani_">Twitter</a>/<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/viveknathani/">Linkedin</a>.</p>

<p>Fun fact: this site was built using a <a href="https://github.com/viveknathani/makesite">tool</a> I wrote.</p>

<p>Since it is very friendly to write in Markdown, I use this site to maintain notes of the things I <a href="./reading">read</a>.</p>

<p>If you are like me who likes to have a minimal notepad open in the browser for rough notes instead of the system's notepad app, you should check <a href="./notes">this</a>.
