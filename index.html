        <p>Hi! I am Vivek. This is my personal space on the internet.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I got into programming when I was about to finish high school. Currently, I build software for the world and for myself. You can find a good description of my work over <a href="/work.html">here</a>. If you are interested in diving into how I write my code and what I put into my commit logs, here is my <a href="https://github.com/viveknathani" target="_blank">Github</a> profile.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Sometimes, I write. My <a href="/blog.html">blog</a> posts are about my technical experiences and general non-technical thoughts.</p>
        <br>
        <p>You can reach out to me on viveknathani2402gmail.com. I am also available on <a href="https://twitter.com/viveknathani_" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/viveknathani" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
