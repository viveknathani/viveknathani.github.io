        <h1 id="goingdownthestack">going down the stack</h1>
<p>For most of my career, I’ve worked in the application layer - APIs, business logic, database queries, infra glue. It’s useful work, but over the years, I’ve found myself getting more curious about what sits underneath it.</p>
<p>That curiosity started in 2023 when a Postgres slowdown at work pushed me into understanding how databases actually work. I picked up <a href="https://www.amazon.in/dp/9352135245">DDIA</a>, learned about LSM trees and B-trees, debugged a pan-India networking issue that sent me deep into DNS, wrote a tiny DNS server for fun, and even built a small Bitcask-style key–value store.</p>
<p>In 2024, I worked with <a href="https://advaitb.com/">Advait</a> at Mars, building a low-latency video streaming pipeline in Rust. We learned Rust on the job, figured out video encoding/decoding, and wrote some of the most intense systems code I’ve touched. We couldn't scale the business further, but it made something obvious: I enjoyed the systems layer a lot more than the application layer.</p>
<p>2025 brought me back to app work for the day job, but in my free time I drifted into systems again — <a href="https://github.com/viveknathani/monkeyc">writing a compiler in C</a>, <a href="https://github.com/viveknathani/numero">building a math expression parser in Go</a>, <a href="https://www.vivekn.dev/blog/vital/">hacking on my exercise bike with a raspberry pi</a>, watching CMU’s 15-445 database course, and slowly orbiting around Postgres internals.</p>
<p>All of this has pointed in one direction: I want to spend some serious time going down the stack.</p>
<p>So that’s the plan for the rest of 2025 and into 2026: learning PostgreSQL deeply, hacking on it if I can, and writing about whatever I discover along the way. No rush, no deadlines, no pressure to “ship fast.” Only slow, focused exploration of a system I genuinely like.</p>
<p>Let’s see where it goes.</p>
