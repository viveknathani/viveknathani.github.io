<p>“Create more than you consume” is an idea we keep hearing. I think this is not exactly possible. Because you are almost always consuming things. Food. News. Or even the quiet presence of a tree outside your window. Pure creation without consumption feels like a myth.</p>
<p>Yet, the spirit of the idea holds a lot of weight. The world consistently rewards those who produce, whether it’s a product, art, software, or a fresh way of thinking. Over time, those who move towards production end up shaping the landscape that others live in.</p>
<p>Sometimes, creation happens from a place of wanting to win. And here’s the thing. Competition kinda sucks. Paras Chopra puts it nicely in his blog of <a href="https://invertedpassion.com/dont-compete/">Don’t Compete</a> where he suggests that societal structures benefit from this competition, as it drives innovation and progress. However, he questions whether this system truly serves the individuals within it. Instead of striving to win in a game set by societal norms, individuals can choose to play their own game, leading to a more authentic and fulfilling life.</p>
<p>For people like me, creation also happens from a place of trying to just have my own version of something. Generally, I don’t like being dependent on too many things. This is an approach I have for both life and software. But, somewhere deep down, I know that dependency is a feature, not a bug. Steve Jobs put it nicely in an email that he wrote to himself in 2010: “I grow little of the food I eat, and of the little I do grow. I did not breed or perfect the seeds. I do not make any of my own clothing. I speak a language did not invent or refine. I did not discover the mathematics I use. I am protected by freedoms and laws I did not conceive of or legislate, and do not enforce or adjudicate. I am moved by music I did not create myself. When I needed medical attention, I was helpless to help myself survive. I did not invent the transistor, the microprocessor, object oriented programming, or most of the technology I work with. I love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being.”</p>
<p>Chanelling your troubles of life into creativity is like a great thing to do. Anxiety, heartbreak, uncertainty, these are raw materials. History shows that some of the most compelling art and innovation come from grappling with discomfort rather than avoiding it.</p>
<p>Also, in the age of AI, creation is increasingly about taste. AI can remix, reword, and even mimic brilliance but it can’t choose what’s worth saying or making in the first place. That’s on you. The act of refining your own taste figuring out what feels true, beautiful, or meaningful, is itself a form of creation.</p>
<p>The producer-consumer problem of life is not about “winning” by producing more than you consume. It’s about cycling between the two in a way that feels meaningful. Sometimes you’ll be a sponge. Sometimes a faucet. The magic is in staying conscious of the flow—and not mistaking one for the goal.</p>
