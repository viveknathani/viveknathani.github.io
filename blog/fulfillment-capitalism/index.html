<p>November 2024</p>
<p>I have spent the last two years of my life working as an engineer in startups. During this time, I have often wondered about my fulfillment in a technical sense. I think I can now firmly establish the fact that I need to put all my heart into the work that I do. Otherwise, it just wouldn’t make sense to me. And I wouldn’t feel motivated to work on the problems that are assigned to me.</p>
<p>I do understand that as an engineer, you will face some periods in your job that are drier than others, in terms of technical excitement. But, on a higher level, I still need to feel I am doing something important. The startup life has turned me into the kind of person that values time. I have a sense of urgency and I am almost always in a hacker mode. And this is really fun. Shipping things quickly and reliably gives me an adrenaline rush. I don’t know for how long I will keep getting this feeling but I am enjoying it while it lasts.</p>
<p>At the same time, there’s another side of me that thrives in slower, more deliberate exploration. I love open-ended research and deep dives into topics like math, computer networking, and gaming. Outside work, I’m not a fast-paced person. My ideal vacation involves lounging with a serene view and a cocktail, not ticking off every tourist activity on a checklist. Similarly, my explorations are often unhurried, driven more by curiosity than by deadlines. It’s the process of digging deeply, not necessarily reaching the finish line, that brings me joy.</p>
<p>But exploratory digging comes with a cost. The cost of time. And I don’t seem to have enough of it. I am still young in my career, trying to make it in this world, by providing engineering value in exchange for money in the short term and wealth in the long term. I hope for a future where I can conduct my research and study about various aspects in a way that I am financially free. Maybe I am a calm university research-oriented kinda guy who just got attracted by the fast-moving capitalistic world because the real world works on ruthless pragmatism whereas the education institutions I had to go through would enforce a wasteful kind of discipline that I felt like running away from.</p>
<p>So what gives me fulfillment? I believe it is a mix of research + study and doing important work of immediate business value. But, the weight of the former seems to keep increasing in my head as time passes. So I think I just we all could make the right amount of money to not worry about our existence while having fun doing exploratory indie hacking.</p>
