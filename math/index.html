<p>I love this subject but I see a pain point in problems being scattered across multiple textbooks. I wished for a simple website with a large list of math problems, parsed from multiple textbooks, and sorted by difficulty. And that's how <a href="https://teachyourselfmath.app/">teachyourselfmath</a> was born.</p>
<p>I got interested in number theory. Spent a good chunk of time (October 2024 - March 2025) working through the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elementary-Number-Theory-David-Burton/dp/0073051888">Elementary Number Theory by David M Burton</a>. I think I am gonna stay interested in this topic for a while.</p>
<p>I also started a math club - <a href="https://teachyourselfmath.app/club">teachyourselfmath.app/club</a>.</p>
<p>For about a month, I spent time learning linear algebra. I watched some lectures by Gilbert Strang, also watched 3b1b's Essence Of Linear Algebra playlist. I just got bored. Despite the great efforts of the creators, I just couldn't get into it. Maybe, I'll give it another shot in the future.</p>
