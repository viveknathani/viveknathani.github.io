# Hi, I am Vivek!
<div>
I am an engineering student based out of India with a passion for software development. My skills include building backends in Node.js and TypeScript, CLI tools in Go and occasionally, building user interfaces using React.  

Find out more about me: [projects](./work) | [blog](./blog) | [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16dQb5zN6FYl0dFurLYl3Ojxdu0qiIdUn/view?usp=sharing)

If you are interested in working with me,  
- write an email to viveknathani2402@gmail.com  
- or DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/viveknathani_)/[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/viveknathani/).  

Fun fact: this site was built using a [tool](https://github.com/viveknathani/makesite) I wrote.

Since it is very friendly to write in Markdown, I use this site to maintain notes of the things I [read](./reading).

If you are like me who likes to have a minimal notepad open in the browser for rough notes instead of the system's notepad app, you should check [this](./notes).
