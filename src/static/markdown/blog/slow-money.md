# slow money - hard learnings from startups, markets, and life

As of today, I’m three years into my career. I’ve lived the fast paced startup life in Bangalore - the kind you’d hear about in every typical story. I’ve witnessed a 0 -> 1 journey as an early employee, co-founded a startup, consulted for a bunch, and now I’m working at what the cool kids call the beginning of “scale”. The thing about life is: while you are busy working on what you presume to be the most important thing, life itself does not wait. Things always keep happening and it can be hard to keep up.

### speed is necessary
Move quickly. Slowness in one place bleeds into everything else. Ship fast, talk to users quickly, keep iterating. Nobody likes working with slow people. Commit to timelines and get shit done. Build a reputation for finishing things, no matter the outcome.

### speed is not sufficient
Direction matters as much as the speed. Make sure you are working on the right thing.

### find your tribe
Building things is hard. Doing it alone is harder. The right people make the journey lighter. Bangalore is overflowing with serendipity if you let it in. People who call this city “lonely” are delusional. When you move somewhere new, no school or college forces you under the same roof anymore. You have to choose to show up. Go to meetups, sit in cafes, volunteer in clubs, give more than you get. Someone on the internet once said: “Inconvenience is the price you pay for community.” Pay it. It’s worth it.

### never work with lala companies
No explanation needed. If you know, you know. And if you don’t, pray you never find out.

### do not invest in the stock market in the early days of your startup
If you’re building a company or working in an early team, markets are a distraction unless your work is directly related. Park your savings somewhere safe and stable. Go disappoint Ankur Warikoo. Focus is the real alpha.

### it is all about people
Products change. Teams reorganize. Companies die. The only constant is people - the ones you build and struggle with. Be kind, have fun, and be a good team player.

### time beats invisible thresholds
A lot of life feels like nothing is happening until suddenly everything is happening. Skills compound quietly. Networks compound quietly. Even your health compounds quietly. But the thresholds where things “click” or break open are always invisible beforehand. Keep showing up with consistency. Time has a way of cracking open doors you didn’t even know existed. Stay in the game long enough and the inflection points take care of themselves.

### everybody knows everybody
The world is unbelievably small. Reputation travels faster than your resume ever will. The person you helped casually in a cafe might recommend you three years later. The intern from your first startup might become a founder. The engineer you treated poorly might sit across from you in a future interview panel. Play long games with long-term people. Be kind. Don’t burn bridges. Don’t be a genius asshole. Goodwill compounds just like everything else, and sooner than you expect, you’ll realize that there are no strangers—just future collaborators, references, mentors, or friends.
