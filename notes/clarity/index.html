<p>Notes from The Book of Clarity by Paras Chopra. Helpful guide for building a startup.</p>
<ol>
<li>Start blank. No ideas. Only consumers.</li>
<li>Identify the user sets you want to build for. </li>
<li>Talk to every user in every set.</li>
<li>Find what they DO, not what they SAY they do.</li>
<li>See if you can find a pattern and do something better for them.</li>
<li>What burning pain can be solved only via your customized offering?</li>
<li>Define your market as narrowly as possible. Be the king of a pond.</li>
<li>Build a really simple product at first, let users help you iterate.</li>
<li>Innovate only on one thing that differentiates your business, copy everything else.</li>
<li>Be irreplaceable in the value chain.</li>
<li>Be cost-focused or quality-focused, not both. It does not work.</li>
<li>Don't price your product based on the value it creates, price it based on the products you want it to be compared with.</li>
<li>What kills startups is lack of feedback.</li>
<li>Cognitive biases are real. Find specific ways in which your idea can fail.</li>
<li>When taking advice, you want to seek feedback from someone who is honest, is an expert in your target market, and does not have a big ego.</li>
<li>When interviewing people, don't ask leading questions. This will lead to confirmation bias.</li>
<li>Approach problems from first principles before using internet or ChatGPT.</li>
<li>Success and failure criteria should be defined before starting the project, not after it ends.</li>
</ol>
